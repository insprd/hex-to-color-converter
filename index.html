    <div>
      Even though the color value was stored as a hex, it's converted by the
      SCSS function and rendered in display-p3 wide gamut.
    </div>

    <div class="plain-hex">Regular hex for comparison</div>

    <p>
      This is especially useful when working in wide gamut color projects in
      design software like Figma and Sketch, which represent color values as hex
      values regardless of color profile.
